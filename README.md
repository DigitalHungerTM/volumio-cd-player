# volumio-cd-player
A python based environment that scans rfid tags, and sends play requests to the volumio API.


## TODO
- make a workflow for the python API
- find good rfid scanner / corresponding python library / code
- learn volumio REST API
- make 3d model
- repurpose speakers
- integrate hifiberry
- buy parts
-   screen
-   rfid scanner
-   rfid tags
-   large (not necessarily fast) USB stick for the server
-   hifiberry dac
-   new amplifier that doesn't buzz (hifiberry amp2? (has dac built in))
